Blockchain Simulation - GitHub Repository  

 1. Blockchain Simulation  
- What it does:  
  - Creates 3 linked blocks (Genesis → Block 1 → Block 2).  
  - Tamper with Block 1 → Breaks chain integrity (hashes mismatch).  
- Key Learnings:  
  - Immutability: Changing one block invalidates all subsequent blocks.  
  - Block Structure: `index`, `data`, `previousHash`, `hash`, `nonce`.  






 2. Proof-of-Work Mining  
- What it does:  
  - Mines a block until its hash starts with "0000".  
  - Tracks nonce attempts and time taken.  
- Key Learnings:  
  - Energy Cost: Higher difficulty = More computations → More energy.  
  - Security: Miners compete to solve puzzles to add blocks.  






 3. Consensus Mechanisms  
- What it simulates:  
  - PoW: Select validator with highest computational power.  
  - PoS: Select validator with highest cryptocurrency stake.  
  - DPoS: Delegates elected via voting.  
- Key Learnings:  
  - PoW: Secure but energy-heavy.  
  - PoS/DPoS: Energy-efficient but requires trust/stakes.  



 Real-World Use Cases  
1. Supply Chain:  
   - Track products from farm to shelf (e.g., Walmart).  
   - Detect fraud instantly.  
2. Digital Identity:  
   - Store IDs on-chain (e.g., Estonia’s e-Residency).  
   - No central database to hack.
