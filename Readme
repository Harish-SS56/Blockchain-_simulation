Blockchain Basics:

A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that stores information in a chain of blocks. Each block contains a group of data (like transactions), a timestamp, a cryptographic hash of its own content, and the hash of the previous block. This creates a secure, tamper-evident chain. Blockchains are maintained by a network of computers (called nodes) that all hold a copy of the entire chain. Any new block must be verified by consensus from the network before being added. This makes blockchain highly secure, transparent, and resistant to fraud or manipulation. Because of its decentralized nature, it removes the need for a central authority, making it ideal for applications where trust, security, and transparency are critical.

Two real-life use cases:
1.Supply Chain Management – Blockchain can track the movement of goods from manufacturer to customer, ensuring authenticity and preventing tampering (e.g., tracking organic food or luxury goods).

2.Digital Identity – Individuals can store and manage their identity documents securely on the blockchain, allowing fast and tamper-proof verification without relying on third parties.

 Merkle Root Explanation :

A Merkle root is a single hash that summarizes all transactions in a block. It is formed by hashing pairs of transaction hashes repeatedly until only one root hash remains.
Example:
If a block contains 4 transactions (Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, Tx4):
1.Hash each transaction:
H1 = hash(Tx1), H2 = hash(Tx2), H3 = hash(Tx3), H4 = hash(Tx4)
2.Combine and hash in pairs:
H12 = hash(H1 + H2), H34 = hash(H3 + H4)
3.Compute Merkle Root:
Root = hash(H12 + H34)
If even one transaction is changed, the root will change helping verify that no data has been altered without checking all transactions individually.


Consensus Conceptualization:

1. What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?

Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks. This requires significant computational effort, as miners must try many values (nonces) to find a valid hash that meets the difficulty condition (e.g., starting with "0000"). The first miner to solve it adds the block and earns a reward. This process requires energy because it consumes CPU/GPU power during continuous calculations, which contributes to high electricity usage in PoW-based systems.

2.What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?

Proof of Stake (PoS) replaces computational effort with economic stake. Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "lock" or stake. The more they stake, the higher the chance of being selected. Unlike PoW, PoS does not require expensive mining hardware or high energy consumption. It is more eco-friendly and efficient, but could lead to centralization if wealthier users dominate the network.

3. What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a variation of PoS where stakeholders vote to elect a few trusted delegates (validators) who are responsible for validating transactions and producing blocks. Token holders use their voting power to choose these delegates, with voting weight proportional to the number of tokens they hold. This system is faster and more scalable than PoW or traditional PoS, but it relies on the elected validators’ honesty, and may introduce some level of centralization due to limited delegate numbers.


Code Tasks:

1. blockchain_simulation.js
What: Build 3 linked blocks.

Demo: Tamper Block 1 → Breaks chain (hashes mismatch).

2. mining_simulation.js
What: Mine a block with "0000" hash.

Demo: Counts attempts/time → Shows PoW effort.

3. consensus_demo.js
What: Simulate PoW, PoS, DPoS validator selection.
